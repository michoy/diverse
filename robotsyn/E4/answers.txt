1d)
The matrix JTJ becomes singular, which means it cannot be inverted (excluding the pseudo-inverse).
This causes problems for the solver, which is probably dependant in inverting the matrix for its calculation.

2a)
Lambda decreases exponentially, theta stabilizes and it took 20 iterations. See images 2a_theta and 2a_lambda for results. 

2b)
No, because the added damping terms alon the diagonal prevent the matrix from becomming sigular.
