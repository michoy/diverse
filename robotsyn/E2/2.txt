a)
Intrinsic:
- Focal length
- coordinates of principle point
- Lens properties (distorion etc.)
- Camera skew

Extrinsic:
- Camera pose 


b) 
Because it's easy and cheap


c)
screen-pro:
it's simple and (slightly) better for the evironment. 

screen-con:
It's more challenging for the camera to adjust the exposure and find the right focus. 
You need an availible screen, which can be a hassel to move.
Low insight angle can be a problem. 

print-pro: 
Very simple and easy for the camera to adjust to.

print-con:
you need a printer 


d)
Parameters: cx, cy, fx, fy, 6 DOF extrinsic = 10
Equations: 2

At least five corresponences.


e)
Zoom(focal length) and camera to object distance.


f)
Many similar photographs in calibration lead to a low repojection error, 
but a bad calibration.
